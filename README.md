# Self-Driving Car Simulation

## Overview
Developed a self-driving car simulation that realistically imitates driving and the environment. It's built around a straightforward but effective neural network, handling the car's autonomous decision-making and collision detection.

## Technical Implementation
The simulation employs parallel processing to efficiently run multiple instances, accelerating the process of finding the most effective neural network. The mutation mechanism ensures continuous improvement and adaptation of the network, contributing to the overall robustness of the simulation.
